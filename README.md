# Husky Hive
This repository serves as a space for our re-envisioned platform to student organization discovery and management at the University of Washington Seattle.

In consideration of the needs across students searching for RSOs, as well as RSO leaders, we are actively developing a space that hopes to centralize student engagement, communications, and involvement with extracurriculars and broader societies. We are currently under construction, but please check back soon! ðŸš§

## Codebase

Our current plan is to create a full-stack website using React JS and Express, as indicated through 'client' and 'server' folders. 

## Build and Deploy

1. Backend (Port 5000):
You want to do `npm run dev` if you are developing the application and `npm run start` otherwise.
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm i
   npm run dev
   ```

   or do 
   ```bash
   npm run start 
   ```
  
2. Frontend (Port 3000):
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm i
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Contribution

Our platform is currently not open to external development or change requests - but please feel free to view our current work as inspiration for your future projects.
